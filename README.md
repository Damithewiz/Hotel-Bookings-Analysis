# hotel-bookings-analysis

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of over 119,000 hotel booking records to uncover key factors influencing reservation outcomes such as cancellations, special requests, and lead times. The dataset contained a mix of numerical and categorical features with missing and redundant values.

## Key Contributions:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values and dropped high-nullity columns (e.g., agent, company) to improve data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Converted date columns to datetime format to enable time-based analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated booking trends by hotel type, cancellation rates, customer types, deposit policies, and seasonal patterns.

## Insights Extracted:

- City hotels had significantly higher cancellation rates than resort hotels.
- Longer lead times correlated with increased cancellation likelihood.
- The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

## Tools Used:
Pandas for data wrangling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
